Project description
I worked on a banking system. It was a web application in a fintech domain. 
The main purpose of this project was to provide an online platform to customers so that they avail various banking services easily from anywhere.
Some key features of this project were email and SMS services, beneficiary services and real time chat support. 
 
Talking about my role in this project, I worked on security at the time of login and beneficiaries where customers could add, edit and remove beneficiaries. I did backend for these modules. 

We used technologies such as Spring Boot,
Spring Security,
Hibernate JPA,
SNMP for email sending,
Angular 12. for this project. 

If I have to talk about my learning from the project, I would say I learnt Teamwork

That's about this project.
