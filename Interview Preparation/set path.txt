Static variale should be acces by class name

Static block gets excuted first
then constructors


Main method is static so its gets called 1st by jvm. 
not all static method called auotomaticalyy.
One satic method can called another static method.

If we declare method as abstract then th class must be abstract also.

we cant create the object of the abstrac class.
 to use the methods of abstract class,crate th object of the sub class of that abstract class.

Example if circle is abstrat and circle is subclass so create the object of circle if we have to use in another clas.


Interface:

In nterface methods are by defaut public and abstract

String:
Literls VS Heap.




In exception handling to print exception in deails:
e.printStrackTrace();


two types of error:
1 checked (checked by compiler)
2. unchecked(not checked by compiler).


Wrapper class:
it will convert primitive variable to object.
Example:
int num1 =10;
Integer e1= num1;  // it also called boxing.

class canot extend muliple classes,but through interface we can extends two classes i.e. implimenting two interfaces.

1st extend then implement,if one class extending another class and one interface also;


Functional interface:
An Interface that contains exactly one abstract method is known as functional interface.
 It can have any number of default, static methods but can contain only one abstract method.
 It can also declare methods of object class.
